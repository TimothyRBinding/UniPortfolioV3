Title: ImplementationOfDijkstrasAlgorithm.py
Name: Tim Binding
Description:
    Programme to show how dijkstras algorithm works using a graph map to work with.
    The programme requires a network map in the form of a textfile to be passed through
    the populate_network function and a text file with the route for the algorithm in
    parse_route to start and end at e.g. A>F. The programme assumes that their are no
    negative weighted vertices and that their will be no routes inputted that are not
    letters and are in the formant of: C>A or B>F.

Node class:
    This node class will be the bases for all nodes, every node in the network
    graph will have a distance from the source value, a visited boolean and the
    ability to check the previous node or set the current node to previous node.

'''
Dijkstra class:
    The dijkstra class contains all of the functions that are required to find
    the shortest path to a node in a graph. This programme takes in a textfile
    that represents a graph of nodes and assigning them default values checks
    all unvisited nodes from the current node and then calculate the tentative
    distance from source.

    In this class several functions take in files from the programme it is
    important to remember for each one of these files to make sure that every
    file that is opened is closed.

        the shortest path algorithm will start and end at.

        of setting the nodes visited state to the calculate_shortest_path

        A for loop is used to go though each neighbour to determine all of the

        in the node and check if they have been visited and they are greater
        than zero this is because if the weight is greater than zero then that
        means that the is an weighted which means their is definitely a path.

        The 'nn' list will have all of the edges (which are columns in the
        graph map) in a node (row on the graph map) appended to it using
        a loop as long as it hasnï¿½t been visited.

        checked.

            nearest neighbour will be set to the tentative distance value that
            was calculated earlier.
